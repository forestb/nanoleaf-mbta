# Introduction
This project brings together the [Nanoleaf Aurora](https://nanoleaf.me/en/) lights and the [MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority)](https://www.mbta.com/) train/subway API. The project was inspired by a desire to build enchanted objects, a concept introduced to me by [David Rose](https://enchantedobjects.com/) - [David Rose's TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_AhhhcceXk).

# What It Does
I live in Boston, Masachusetts, on South Huntington Avenue, just in front of the Green Line E-branch "Back of the Hill" train stop.  Using the 12 Nanoleaf Aurora lights mounted on my living room wall, this app will paint any outbound train position within a 12 minute radius as a green triangle/panel.

# How It Works
This runs as a Node.js console application on a timer.
